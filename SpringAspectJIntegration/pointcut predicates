execution - for matching method execution join points, this is the primary pointcut designator you will
use when working with Spring AOP

• within - limits matching to join points within certain types (simply the execution of a method declared
within a matching type when using Spring AOP)

• this - limits matching to join points (the execution of methods when using Spring AOP) where the bean
reference (Spring AOP proxy) is an instance of the given type

• target - limits matching to join points (the execution of methods when using Spring AOP) where the
target object (application object being proxied) is an instance of the given type

• args - limits matching to join points (the execution of methods when using Spring AOP) where the
arguments are instances of the given types

• @target - limits matching to join points (the execution of methods when using Spring AOP) where the
class of the executing object has an annotation of the given type

@args - limits matching to join points (the execution of methods when using Spring AOP) where the
runtime type of the actual arguments passed have annotations of the given type(s)

• @within - limits matching to join points within types that have the given annotation (the execution of
methods declared in types with the given annotation when using Spring AOP)

• @annotation - limits matching to join points where the subject of the join point (method being executed
in Spring AOP) has the given annotation
